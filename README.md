# RAV
Replicated the rav website and tried to incoporate sql database in the data storage.

This project was created for the technical exam for RAV. The problem was broken down to two parts: 1) to replicate the website 2) to use crud api in querying data
from a database.

I used flask to replicate the website and everything seems to be working fine. Below is the screenshot of the website on the flask development server:
